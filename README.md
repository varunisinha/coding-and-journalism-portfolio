## Task
This is a web application for a potential employee's portfolio. In this case the employee is Varuni Sinha, an arts journalist.
The user will be able to see the published works of the writer accross platforms such as Time Out New York, Syracuse New Times, The Post and Courier, and in recent animated comic book series TheDriver. 

The user will also be able to see a web application project deployed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS alongwith 2 other projects linked to their deployed websites on Github. When the user hovers over each project the screenshot of the deployed application will become visible. Upon clicking the user can visit those projects and their github repos. 

The wesbite is responsive in design. When the user clicks on the navigation bar, the user will scroll down to the corressponding section on the webpage.
All the projects in the journalist's portfolio have images. 
The first application/section of the portfolio is larger in size compared to the rest. 
Upon hovering on each section of the portfolio, the transparency of the image changes.
Upon clicking on the title of the project, the user is taken to the deployed website. 
When the user resizes the page or views the website on various screens and devices, a responsive design is made accessible.
The HTML page of the web application has a relevant title tag and is categorized according to semantic elements.
