             <p class ="para">I am a New York City-based writer, photographer, and multimedia producer. I am trained as a cultural journalist with expertise in literature and visual studies. I have written reviews for The Post and Courier, quirky pieces for Time Out New York, and produced Wikipedia entries on art for the Guggenheim.
             I started my career as a copywriter, creating 360-degree campaigns for global brands such as Panasonic, Yamaha, Alstom, and the Government of India. I am proficient in writing copy for print advertisements, scripting television commercials, feature films, and radio jingles. I have experience curating click worthy digital content for social media across channels aimed at diverse audiences.
            
          
            <br><br>
            I have skills in front-end programming with working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can work with clients to develop the overall look and design of a website, produce and maintain user interfaces, and ensure their designs are responsive to platforms such as laptops and mobile phones. I can create tools that enhance the user's website experience and incorporate applications, graphics, audio, and video clips. I can also routinely test the websites for ease of use, speed, and fix any bugs that arise.
            
            <br><br>As you scroll down, you can take a glimpse of a web application called Game-Time that allows a team's management to schedule events for a football team 
            using this interface. The application allows the user to check weather updates for upto a week and schedule events based off those predictions.

            ou can also browse a simple quiz app that tests the coding acumen of the user by engaging in a Multiple Choice game created using Javascript and another 
            javascript-based app that allows a user to create a password using parameters that he/she/them pick. When you hover over each application below you will be able
            to see a screenshot of the interface. Upon clicking you will go to straight to the deployed link of the application.
